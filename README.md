The event loop is a crucial component of the JavaScript language, responsible for managing asynchronous operations and ensuring that the code executes in a non-blocking way.In essence, the event loop continuously monitors the JavaScript runtime environment for events or tasks to execute, such as user input or network requests. These events are then added to a queue, which is processed one task at a time, in the order they were added. When a task is executed, the event loop will check if the task is synchronous or asynchronous. If the task is synchronous, it will execute immediately and the event loop will move on to the next task in the queue. If the task is asynchronous, it will be moved to a separate thread for execution, and the event loop will continue to process other tasks in the queue.Once the asynchronous task is completed, its result is placed in a callback queue, which is also monitored by the event loop. If there are any callbacks waiting in the queue, the event loop will execute them one at a time, in the order they were added.Overall, the event loop is responsible for managing the execution of tasks in a way that is both efficient and non-blocking, ensuring that the JavaScript code remains responsive and performant even when dealing with complex and time-consuming operations.

Timers: In this phase, the event loop checks for any scheduled timer tasks that have reached their designated timeout value. If any such tasks are found, they are moved to the task queue for execution in the next phase.
Pending, Idle, prepare: This phase is rarely used in practice, and is mainly reserved for internal use by the Node.js runtime.
Poll: In this phase, the event loop waits for new I/O events or timer tasks to be added to the task queue. If any such events or tasks are found, they are processed immediately. If not, the event loop will wait until new events or tasks are added.                                                           
Check: In this phase, the event loop executes any callbacks that were added to the task queue during the previous phases. This phase is typically used for handling callbacks related to the completion of I/O events.
Close callbacks: In this final phase, the event loop executes any remaining close callbacks related to the closing of network connections or other resources.
